# Additional resources for quantum computing

Arguably the best (read as: most involved) notes on quantum computing (QC) are from John Preskill's [lecture notes](http://www.theory.caltech.edu/~preskill/ph229/#lecture) at CalTech. Almost everything is covered in sufficient detail, but we may not require this level of depth.

Next, the standard QC textbook is that of [Nielson and Chuang](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/quantum-computation-and-quantum-information/01E10196D0A682A6AEFFEA52D53BE9AE). Again, a large level of detail that may not be relevant, but provides a very complete background in combination with Preskill's notes.

A very nice introduction is also given by Microsoft's [QDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/quantum/concepts/?view=qsharp-preview). Basic introductory examples and building blocks are introduced here. Additionally, the QDK [Quantum Katas](https://github.com/Microsoft/QuantumKatas) offer some very nice introductory exercises for examining the effect of quantum operations on states. I wrote [an installer](https://github.com/mlxd/duqt) for this last year that pulls in the bulk of all available quantum SDKs (though only tested on Centos7 and ArchLinux), and sets up the environment (no guarantees on a Mac though).

# Background material from Coecke, et al in Oxford.

I have created a database of useful theses, and complimentary papers using Zotero, a bibliography management program. The database is available on Google Drive [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SV8j7FBA-evKmAx-TtlAdz4sWUhSs2sH?usp=sharing).
The best way to access the materials is to download Zotero, download a local copy of this DB, and point Zotero to the directory in `Preferences -> Files and Folders -> Custom`

I expect to add resources to this over time, and if requested I can make the Drive folder writeable so others can do like-wise.
