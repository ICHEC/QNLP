\section{Discussions and Summary}
\label{sec:discussion_and_summary}

In this document we have discussed our implemented solution for the closest vector problem as part of the QNLP project. We have used the encoding method proposed by Trugenberger~\cite{Trugenberger_2001}, as well as the Hamming distance approach discussed in the same paper and \cite{Schuld_Sinayskiy_Petruccione_2014}. We have opted to use post-selection~\cite{Aaronson_2005} with repeated experimental preparation and measurements to obtain a distribution of closeness between the encoded vector data, and a given test vector. While the use of post-selection over $2^n$ states does not allow for a fully scalable model of computation, this approach allows for a proof-of-concept demonstration of the closest-vector approach taken for NLP tasks.
