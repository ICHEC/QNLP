At the core of our algorithms are fast and coherent quantum methods for computing distance metrics such as the inner product and Euclidean distance. We prove upper bounds on the number of queries to the input data required to compute these metrics. In the worst case, our quantum algorithms lead to polynomial reductions in query complexity relative to the corresponding classical algorithm. In certain cases, we show exponential or even super-exponential reductions over the classical analog. We study the performance of our quantum nearest-neighbor algorithms on several real-world binary classification tasks and find that the classification accuracy is competitive with classical methods.}, note={arXiv: 1401.2142}, journal={arXiv:1401.2142 [quant-ph]}, author={Wiebe, Nathan and Kapoor, Ashish and Svore, Krysta}, year={2014}, month={Jan} }


@phdthesis{Schuld_2017, title={Quantum machine learning for supervised pattern recognition.}, url={http://researchspace.ukzn.ac.za/handle/10413/15748}, abstractNote={Humans are experts at recognising patterns in past experience and applying them to new tasks. For example, after seeing pictures of a face we can usually tell if another image contains the same person or not. Machine learning is a research discipline at the intersection of computer science, statistics and mathematics that investigates how pattern recognition can be performed by machines and for large amounts of data. Since a few years machine learning has come into the focus of quantum computing in which information processing based on the laws of 
quantum theory is explored. Although large scale quantum computers are still in the first stages of development, their theoretical description is well-understood and can be used to formulate `quantum software’ or `quantum algorithms’ for pattern recognition. Researchers can therefore analyse the impact quantum computers may have on intelligent data mining. This approach is part of the emerging research discipline of quantum machine learning that harvests synergies between quantum computing and machine learning. 
The research objective of this thesis is to understand how we can solve a slightly more specific problem called supervised pattern recognition based on the language that has been developed for universal quantum computers. The contribution it makes is twofold: First, it presents a methodology that understands quantum machine learning as the combination of data encoding into quantum systems and quantum optimisation. Second, it proposes several quantum algorithms for supervised pattern recognition. These include algorithms for convex and non-convex optimisation, implementations of distance-based methods through quantum interference, and the preparation of quantum states from which solutions can be derived via sampling. Amongst the machine learning methods considered are least-squares linear regression, gradient descent and Newton’s method, k-nearest neighbour, neural networks as well as ensemble methods. Together with the growing body of literature, this thesis demonstrates that quantum computing offers a number of interesting tools for machine learning applications, and has the potential to create new models of how to learn from data.}, author={Schuld, Maria}, year={2017} }

The encoding of the data can be categorized into two types; analog-encoding where the data are stored as amplitudes of a state, and digital-encoding where they are stored as qubit-strings. The former has been utilized to process classical data in an exponentially large space of a quantum system, where as the latter is required to perform arithmetics on a quantum computer. Quantum algorithms like HHL achieve quantum speedups with a sophisticated use of these two encodings. In this work, we present algorithms that converts these two encodings to one another. While quantum digital-to-analog conversions have implicitly been used in existing quantum algorithms, we reformulate it and give a generalized protocol that works probabilistically. On the other hand, we propose an deterministic algorithm that performs a quantum analog-to-digital conversion. These algorithms can be utilized to realize high-level quantum algorithms such as a nonlinear transformation of amplitude of a quantum state. As an example, we construct a “quantum amplitude perceptron”, a quantum version of neural network, and hence has a possible application in the area of quantum machine learning.}, note={arXiv: 1805.11250}, number={1}, journal={Physical Review A}, author={Mitarai, Kosuke and Kitagawa, Masahiro and Fujii, Keisuke}, year={2019}, month={Jan} }

Rev. Lett. 100, 160501 (2008)]. Due to a result of Regev and Schiff [ICALP ’08 pp. 773], we show that for a class of error models the error rate per gate in the bucket brigade quantum memory has to be of order $o(2^{-n/2})$ (where $N=2^n$ is the size of the memory) whenever the memory is used as an oracle for the quantum searching problem. We conjecture that this is the case for any realistic error model that will be encountered in practice, and that for algorithms with super-polynomially many oracle queries the error rate must be super-polynomially small, which further motivates the need for quantum error correction. By contrast, for algorithms such as matrix inversion [Phys. Rev. Lett. 103, 150502 (2009)] or quantum machine learning [Phys. Rev. Lett. 113, 130503 (2014)] that only require a polynomial number of queries, the error rate only needs to be polynomially small and quantum error correction may not be required. We introduce a circuit model for the quantum bucket brigade architecture and argue that quantum error correction for the circuit causes the quantum bucket brigade architecture to lose its primary advantage of a small number of “active” gates, since all components have to be actively error corrected.}, note={arXiv: 1502.03450}, number={12}, journal={New Journal of Physics}, author={Arunachalam, Srinivasan and Gheorghiu, Vlad and Jochym-O’Connor, Tomas and Mosca, Michele and Srinivasan, Priyaa Varshinee}, year={2015}, month={Dec}, pages={123010} }

This mathematical framework enables us to compute the meaning of a well-typed sentence from the meanings of its constituents. Concretely, the type reductions of Pregroups are `lifted’ to morphisms in a category, a procedure that transforms meanings of constituents into a meaning of the (well-typed) whole. Importantly, meanings of whole sentences live in a single space, independent of the grammatical structure of the sentence. Hence the inner-product can be used to compare meanings of arbitrary sentences, as it is for comparing the meanings of words in the distributional model. The mathematical structure we employ admits a purely diagrammatic calculus which exposes how the information flows between the words in a sentence in order to make up the meaning of the whole sentence.

This approach lead to a unification of several ideas, as well as several results and methods that have not previously appeared in either side of the literature. Our approach enabled the development of a tensor network framework allowing a solution to the quantum decomposition problem which has several appealing features. Specifically, given an n-body quantum state S, we present a new and general method to factor S into a tensor network of clearly defined building blocks. We use the solution to expose a previously unknown and large class of quantum states which we prove can be sampled efficiently and exactly.

 @article{Coecke_Paquette_Pavlovic_2009, title={Classical and quantum structuralism}, url={http://arxiv.org/abs/0904.1997}, abstractNote={In recent work, symmetric dagger-monoidal (SDM) categories have emerged as a convenient categorical formalization of quantum mechanics. The objects represent physical systems, the morphisms physical operations, whereas the tensors describe composite systems. Classical data turn out to correspond to Frobenius algebras with some additional properties. They express the distinguishing capabilities of classical data: in contrast with quantum data, classical data can be copied and deleted. The algebraic approach thus shifts the paradigm of “quantization” of a classical theory to “classicization” of a quantum theory. Remarkably, the simple SDM framework suffices not only for this conceptual shift, but even allows us to distinguish the deterministic classical operations (i.e. functions) from the nondeterministic classical operations (i.e. relations), and the probabilistic classical operations (stochastic maps). Moreover, a combination of some basic categorical constructions (due to Kleisli, resp. Grothendieck) with the categorical presentations of quantum states, provides a resource sensitive account of various quantum-classical interactions: of classical control of quantum data, of classical data arising from quantum measurements, as well as of the classical data processing in-between controls and measurements. A salient feature here is the graphical calculus for categorical quantum mechanics, which allows a purely diagrammatic representation of classical-quantum interaction.}, note={arXiv: 0904.1997}, journal={arXiv:0904.1997 [quant-ph]}, author={Coecke, Bob and Paquette, Eric Oliver and Pavlovic, Dusko}, year={2009}, month={Apr} }

    abstract = { I study the class of problems efficiently solvable by a quantum computer, given the ability to ‘postselect’ on the outcomes of measurements. I prove that this class coincides with a classical complexity class called PP, or probabilistic polynomial-time. Using this result, I show that several simple changes to the axioms of quantum mechanics would let us solve PP-complete problems efficiently. The result also implies, as an easy corollary, a celebrated theorem of Beigel, Reingold and Spielman that PP is closed under intersection, as well as a generalization of that theorem due to Fortnow and Reingold. This illustrates that quantum computing can yield new and simpler proofs of major results about classical computation. }

A key observation is that the monoidal category of (ﬁnite dimensional) vector spaces, linear maps and the tensor product, as well as any pregroup, are examples of compact closed categories. Since, by deﬁnition, a pregroup is a compact closed category with trivial morphisms, its compositional content is reﬂected within the compositional structure of any non-degenerate compact closed category. The (slightly reﬁned) category of vector spaces enables us to compute the meaning of a compound well-typed sentence from the meaning of its constituents, by ‘lifting’ the type reduction mechanisms of pregroup semantics to the whole category. These sentence meanings live in a single space, independent of the grammatical structure of the sentence. Hence we can use the inner-product to compare meanings of arbitrary sentences.
