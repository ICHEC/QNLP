The QNLP implemented quantum Fourier transform routines complement the pre-existing qHiPSTER routines
by allowing a selective set of indices to bound the transform on the register. This is useful for
instances when a register is sub-divided into many separate purposes, and a transform over all available
qubits is not necessary.
