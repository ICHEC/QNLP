# QNLP - Quantum Natural Language Processing
<img src="https://travis-ci.com/ICHEC/QNLP.svg?branch=master">

In this software suite we have developed a workflow to implement a hybridised classical-quantum model for representing language and representing sentence meanings in quantum states [1].

## The model

This work is based upon and inspired by the **DisCo** (also known as **DisCoCat**) formalism of Coecke *et al.* [2,3,4], wherein both compositional and distributional sentence structure and information is used to represent meaning. Following the work on Zeng and Coecke [4], we aimed to implement a modified approach to implement this model for quantum processors. Further details will follow shortly in the upcoming paper.

## Requirements

To build and run this software suite it is recommended to have the Intel compilers and Intel MPI libraries. We make use of the Intel Quantum Simulator (Intel-QS, qHiPSTER) [5,6] as the underlying simulator for our methods. If not available, the build can use GCC/Clang, provided the toolchain supports C++14 at a minimum (C++17 prefered). In addition, an MPI library is required. We have successfully used both MPICH and OpenMPI with non-Intel compiler builds. 

This suite is primarily developed for Linux HPC systems, though it may also run on laptops/desktops. MacOS can be used, but some additional work is necessary.
