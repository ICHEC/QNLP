# QNLP

Intel and ICHEC identified the opportunity to leverage the [Intel Quantum Simulator](https://github.com/intel/intel-qs) to port and implement a quantum version of an existing compositional semantics NLP algorithm to analyse the meaning sentences in a corpus. This project aims to

 - Leverage and evaluate the computing power that quantum devices can offer to computation intensive NLP algorithms such as in the distributional compositional semantics model.

 - Develop the ecosystem of proof-of-concept applications ported to the emerging quantum computing domain, particularly using a highly relevant application domain such as NLP.

 - Pioneer a collaborative innovation environment in Ireland between industry and research organisations to develop expertise to program quantum computers.
