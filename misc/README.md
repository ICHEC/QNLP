# Miscellaneous Tools and Build Instructions
This directory contains useful tools for tuning your environment for more significant performance improvements when using Intel-QS in a HPC environment. It also contains instructions for building the QNLP libarary on MacOS.

## Performance Optimisations
A very simple way of gaining a possible performance increase was by specifying the environemt variable `I_MPI_TUNING_BIN`. 
### MPI's Autotuining

## Building Intel-QS on MacOS
