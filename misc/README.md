# Miscellaneous Tools and Build Instructions

This directory consists of subdirectories which contain useful tools for tuning and analysing the parallel performance of your application. It also has a subdirectory with detailed build instructions for building the QNLP library on MacOS.

 your environment for a potentially significant performance improvement when using Intel-QS in a HPC environment. Instructions and scripts for running Intel's parallel profiling tools are provided in `perf_analysis`. Instructions for building the QNLP libarary on MacOS are provided in `MacOS_build_instructions/README.md`.

## Performance Optimisations

A very simple way of gaining a potentially significant performance improvement is by specifying the environemt variable `I_MPI_TUNING_BIN` to a configuration file generated by the Intel parallel tool suite when installed. A further performance improvement can be obtained by running Intel MPI's Autotuning tool to generate a configuration file made specifically for your target application.

Scripts for running Intel MPI's Autotuning tool and comparing different versions of configuration files (ie running applications with generated configuration files) are provided in `mpi_autotune`.

### MPI's Autotuining

If using a version of Intel Parallel Studio XE Cluster Edition, Intel's parallel profiling tools are provided. `perf_analysis_tools` provides SLURM run scripts for each of the performance tools provided in Intel's Parallel Studio XE Cluster Edition. It also provides a run script for exploring different NUMA topologies by means of experimentation and comparison.

## Building Intel-QS on MacOS

`MacOS_build_instructions` provides detailed instructions for building QNLP and Intel-QS on a MacOS. Although the performance and scaling of applciations on PC/laptop device is very limited, it is a very useful development tool.
