# Contributing

Thank you for taking the time to contribute to this work. We offer the following as guidelines to ensure a smooth process to review your thoughts, ideas, suggestions and contributed work.

- Read the Code of Conduct before starting. This ensures all of our interactions are in a friendly manner. Any language, or implications that do not adhere to the COC will cause us to reject the issue and/or pull request.
- Before creating a pull request, please create an Issue of the feature, bug, or comments, and tag with the appropriate type.
- Please outline your observed behaviour (if a bug), or intended behavior (if a feature request). Any additional information that you can provide would also be beneficial.
- Once you have created an issue, if you intend to submit a pull request, please reference the issue in the title of the pull request. This makes tracking things much easier for us.
- Be patient. We have full-time positions outside this work, and so may take some time to respond. We do value all help with improving the work.

# Style-guide

While we have not yet formally standardised the code styles, it is preferred if you use spaces over tabs (for now). Additionally, if submitting C++ code, please use K&R indentation with 1TBS (opening braces on the same line as as method/function declaration), unless another style provides better readability (e.g. methods with many arguments). Explicit use of Allman style will ensure the pull request is not accepted until it has been adopted to K&R. Thanks for you understanding.
